### Features and Functionalities of This Website:

This is an event management website where people can find different types of social event management packages, such as marriage event organizing, birthdays, anniversaries, engagements, retirements, and baby showers.

- In this website's navbar, there is an active routing system. For example, if I go to the "Home" route, the "Home" button will appear differently compared to others, indicating that it's the active page.

- On the right side of the navbar, there will be user information displayed if the user is logged in. If the user isn't logged in, a login button will be shown by default.

- The banner section is not static; it's an image slider banner that automatically changes the banner picture.

- Below the banner, there are six service-related cards, each featuring an image, a short description, and a "View Details" button. If people click the "View Details" button, it will redirect them to the details page. If the user is logged in, they will be taken directly to the details page. If the user is not logged in, they will be redirected to the login page.

- After logging in, users will be redirected to the page they originally intended to visit.

- In the registration page, there are four fields to fill out: full name, profile image, valid email, and password. Users must complete all the fields; otherwise, they will receive an error message. Additionally, if the user doesn't meet the password criteria, such as having a minimum of six characters with at least one capital letter and one special character, they will see an error message below the password field.

- On the registration and login forms, there is a toggle button. If a new user clicks it, the login page will redirect to the registration page. If a user already has an account, clicking the toggle button will redirect to the login page. -->
